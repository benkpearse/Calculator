    st.markdown("""
    #### What is Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)?
    **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)** tells you the smallest improvement (uplift) your test is likely to detect with a given amount of data and a desired level of power. If the true uplift is smaller than the MDE, you probably won‚Äôt find a statistically significant result, not because the uplift isn't real, but because your test isn't sensitive enough. Use MDE to set realistic expectations: if your calculated MDE is 5%, don‚Äôt expect to reliably detect a 2% improvement.

    ---
    #### What Does Power Mean in Bayesian A/B Testing?
    In this context, Bayesian power answers the question: **"If the true uplift is X%, what is the probability that our test will correctly conclude that the variant is better than the control?"** We define "correctly conclude" as the posterior probability `P(B > A)` exceeding our chosen confidence threshold (e.g., 95%). For example, 80% power means that if the true uplift really exists, 80% of the time we run this test, we'll get a significant result. This helps you avoid launching tests that are underpowered and likely to fail from the start.

    ---
    #### About Priors in Bayesian A/B Testing
    Priors represent your beliefs about the conversion rate *before* running the test. A **Beta prior** is defined by two shape parameters:
    - **Alpha ($$\\alpha$$)**: Represents prior successes.
    - **Beta ($$\\beta$$)**: Represents prior failures.

    * **Uninformative Prior**: If you have no strong prior belief, use `alpha = 1` and `beta = 1`. This is a uniform prior, meaning all conversion rates are considered equally likely initially.
    * **Informative Prior**: If you have historical data, you can encode it. For `1,000` historical observations and a `5%` conversion rate, your priors would be:
        - `alpha = 1000 * 0.05 = 50`
        - `beta = 1000 * (1 - 0.05) = 950`

    Using good priors makes your tests more data-efficient.
